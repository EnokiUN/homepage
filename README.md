# Enoki's Homepage

An over-engineered feature-filled home page for my browser that I made because I
was bored.

## Features

- Pinned websites, easily change them in the script.js file.
- Commands to be able to do stuff quickly-er.
- Fancy looking *as long as you don't try to open it on mobile :)*

Feel free to fork it, edit it, use it, improve it and do whatever you want with
it :p
